# mr-grip
Allele coding invariant version of MR-Egger/IVW.  This is work in progress.

The file `mr-grip.R` contains the `mr_grip` function which is compatible with the `TwoSampleMR` library.

Run the function directly with
`mr_grip(b_exp, b_out, se_exp, se_out, parameters)`

Currently, no additional parameters are required.
